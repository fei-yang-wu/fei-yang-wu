		My research interests lie in the intersection of optimization,
		reinforcement learning, and robotics. I develop algorithms to
		efficiently train robots, ideally with theoretical guarantee. I am
		co-advised by Prof. Anqi Wu and Prof. Ye Zhao at Georgia Tech.

		Additionally, I had the privilege to collaborate with Prof. George Lan
		on stochastic optimization & RL. Previously, I contributed to the
		development team of optimization solvers for large-scale linear
		programming problems at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen
		(CUHKSZ), where I spent my undergrad years in computer science and
		engineering.
